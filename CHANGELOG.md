### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

- The extension now attempts to use locally installed
  copies of commitlint libraries to load commitlint configurations, parse
  commit messages, and apply linting rules. If locally installed libraries

  extension will be used instead, as they were previously.
- The bundled version of commitlint is now version 13
  (updated from 11).
